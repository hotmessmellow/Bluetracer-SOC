# 90-second Demo Script

1) "This is my BlueTrace QR4Beacon lab. It correlates email, DNS, and PowerShell signals."
2) "Hereâ€™s a synthetic email URL domain flagged; now, within 30 minutes, the same host queries that domain."
3) "We also detect mshta launching a remote HTA and PowerShell with EncodedCommand. Notice the weighted KQL hit."
4) "Finally, the DNS periodicity query surfaces beacon-like intervals. This is our MITRE mapping and the first-hour runbook."
5) "The takeaway: explainable detections + cross-signal correlation you can replay today."
